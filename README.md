This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Check your environment

Make sure you have JDK 17 and latest version of Node

## Step 2: Add .env file

You need to create .env file at root directory to add the required env variables. you can rename
the file .env.example to .env

## Step 3: Install Dependencies 

You need to install dependencies using 

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn install
# then to install pods
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## Step 4: Start the Metro Server

You will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 5: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
